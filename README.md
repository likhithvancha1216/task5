## Objective  
Capture live network traffic using Wireshark, identify key protocols, and analyze selected packets.

---

## Deliverables  
- `Wireshark Packet Capture Analysis.png` — screenshot preview of capture  
- `report.md` — short analysis report with protocols, endpoints, and findings  
- `commands.md` — Wireshark filters and analysis commands used  

---

## How to Use This Repo  

1. View `Wireshark Packet Capture Analysis.png` for a visual preview of the capture.  
2. Read `report.md` for analysis (protocols observed, notable packets, conclusions, recommendations).  
3. Check `commands.md` for Wireshark filters and relevant commands (e.g., `dns`, `tcp.port==443`, `icmp`).

## Notes & Privacy  
- The screenshot includes sample traffic (DNS, TCP, TLS, ICMP, ARP).  
- IPs and domains should be sanitized if sharing publicly.  
- TLS traffic remains encrypted without `SSLKEYLOGFILE` or keys.  
- Capture duration: ~60 seconds (29-09-2025, 11:00–11:01 IST).
